My name is Dottie!

You may know me as the "titkok" skin that sits on the benches at docks. I have never in my life downloaded TikTok so if you expect me to understand the app's lingo/drama then,,, my bad 🏃.

My pronouns are she/her. Though I like to refer to myself as a boy/man. 

My pet peeve is when you mfs sit in the MIDDLE of the bench. It can comfortably fit TWO ppl there so MOVE YOUR ASS and leave space for others. If you sit in the middle of it alone, I WILL sit next to you idc. I'M the bench boy, I'm the one who SITS!

I'm mostly AFK but I also watch. 👁👁 You can interact with me if you'd like, I'll try my best to respond. I like to interact with people. :)

I do not have TT/TD so you can do whatever you want. I'll just hide you if you really took it too far.
